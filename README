// We are going to create a etch a skecth project
// Where we can draw with the mouse on the website
// If we hover over the squares we can set it to change de color


// I have finish for now with my project
// I have learned how to work with flex containers in a more advance level
// The script was pretty easy to set up
// But of course I had to google a lot, to find the correct syntax
// But once I figured out a couple of thing it was easy to solve the little problems
// I think this is going to be my final version
// But maybe in the future I can add more functions to it and rework the code, make it more simple
// Sometimes I struggle in reworking the code, as I had to change everything from my original idea
// But it works perfectly now
